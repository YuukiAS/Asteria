# Frontend Brand and Creative Assets

Use this skill for visual identity and marketing-facing creative, separate from
application UI implementation.

## Scope

- Brand voice and messaging.
- Visual identity and style guides.
- Logo usage and color palette management.
- Website hero visuals and banners.
- Social media images and campaign assets.
- HTML slides and pitch decks.
- Icon style and icon systems.

## Workflow

1. Gather purpose, platform, dimensions, audience, content, and brand constraints.
2. Check for existing brand guidelines or assets.
3. Pick an art direction that supports the message.
4. Define typography, color, imagery, layout, and export requirements.
5. Produce multiple directions only when exploration is requested.
6. Validate consistency against brand tokens.

## Output Rules

- Do not invent brand facts, metrics, or claims.
- Use exact platform dimensions when known.
- Keep logos and marks clear at small sizes.
- Avoid text-heavy social assets unless the platform and goal support it.
- Separate brand creative from product UI when their constraints differ.
